# Neighborhood-Enlargement-in-Graph-Network
This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of Neighborhood Enlargement in Graph Network which is submitted
It's based on the implementation of How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?[Github](https://github.com/weihua916/powerful-gnns)

Default parameters are not the best performing-hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameters need to be specified through the commandline arguments. Please refer to submitted paper for the details of how we set the hyper-parameters. The proposed method is set as --neighbor_pooling_type = sum1

Type

```
python main.py --help
```

to learn hyper-parameters to be specified.

Stay Tune for results of more benchmarks.
